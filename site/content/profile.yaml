    "On a journey to explore the world of E-Commerce...and loving every moment of it!"

    Hi there! My name is Sageewan (Sah-jee-wen) but I go by Saj.

I am a new graduate from Computer Engineering (Innovation Stream) at Queen's University looking to continue my journey as a Full-stack Developer.
